## HDRP AOV

Added compatibility with [HDRP Arbitrary Output Variables(AOV)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0/manual/AOVs.html), which makes it possible to record Beauty, Albedo, Normal and other AOV sequential images using Recorder later than 3.0.

When using HDRP AOV, [Outline](Outline.md) needs to be desabled. Please, refer to [Known Issues](Known-issue.md).

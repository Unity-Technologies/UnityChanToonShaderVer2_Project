![](images/TPK_04.png)


The Unity Toon Shader (UTS3) is a toon shader made by Unity, which is designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3D-CG animations. 

Unity Toon Shader is compatible with all the render pipelines, Legacy(built-in) render pipeline, Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).  However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to the Feature difference for each render pipeline for details.

Unity Toon Shader is  the successor of Unity-chan Toon Shader ver 2.0 (UTS2), which was solely for Legacy/Built-in Render Pipeline. All the parameters are compatible with the predecessor. Please refer to the UTS2 to UTS3 Migration for details.
